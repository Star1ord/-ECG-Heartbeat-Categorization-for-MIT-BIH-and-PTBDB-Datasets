## Logistic Regression with Regularization and K-Nearest Neighbors for Classification

This repository showcases the application of Logistic Regression with L1 and L2 regularization, along with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), for binary classification of heartbeat conditions using the [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat) sourced from Kaggle.

### Dataset

The **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset** is a valuable collection of ECG recordings, providing diverse heartbeat classes including Normal, Supraventricular Ectopic, Premature Ventricular Contraction, Fusion of Ventricular and Normal Beat, and Unclassifiable Beat.

### Features

- **Models Used:**
  - Logistic Regression with L1 and L2 regularization
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with k=5
- **Objective:** Predict heartbeat conditions (binary classification)
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

### Key Highlights

- **Logistic Regression:**
  - Utilizes L1 and L2 regularization to control model complexity and prevent overfitting.
  - Provides a probabilistic output suitable for binary classification.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
  - A non-parametric classification technique based on the k closest training samples.
  - Utilized with k=5 neighbors for binary classification in this example.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the logistic regression and KNN examples for binary classification of heartbeat conditions.
3. Analyze the impact of L1 and L2 regularization on logistic regression's performance.
4. Experiment with different datasets and classification objectives using logistic regression and KNN.
