Logistic Regression with Regularization and K-Nearest Neighbors for Classification
This repository showcases the application of Logistic Regression with L1 and L2 regularization, along with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), for binary classification of heartbeat conditions using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset sourced from Kaggle.

Dataset
The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset is a valuable collection of ECG recordings, providing diverse heartbeat classes including Normal, Supraventricular Ectopic, Premature Ventricular Contraction, Fusion of Ventricular and Normal Beat, and Unclassifiable Beat.

Features

Key Highlights
Logistic Regression:

Utilizes L1 and L2 regularization to control model complexity and prevent overfitting.
Provides a probabilistic output suitable for binary classification.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

A non-parametric classification technique based on the k closest training samples.
Utilized with k=5 neighbors for binary classification in this example.
